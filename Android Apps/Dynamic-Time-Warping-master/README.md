# Dynamic-Time-Warping
This Android application demonstrates how the [Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/05a2/0cde15e172fc82f32774dd0cf4fe5827cad2.pdf) algorithm can be applied to recognizing the _shape_ of waveform data. This is a very useful ability to have for applications which need to interpret time-domain signals, such as physical gestures from an accelerometer.

## How to Use
Download and run the application. In **Training** mode, tapping and holding on the screen will start recording accelerometer data, so hold down on the screen for the period of the gesture you'd like to record. Select **Recognition** mode by tapping the `Switch` on the bottom-right of the screen. In **Recognition** mode, recorded gestures are compared to those made in **Training** mode using the DTW algorithm. 

The error calculations, here referred to as _distance_, are returned to the user via a `Toast`. Each individual axis of the accelerometer has it's own distance measurement for the period of the gesture.
